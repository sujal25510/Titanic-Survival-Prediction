 The goal of the project is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a passenger will survive the historic Titanic shipwreck. The Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes details about the passengers like age, gender, and ticket
 class, will be used in our work. We will train a logistic regression model and use GridSearchCV to optimize its hyperparameters in order to attain the best possible performance after completing the required data preprocessing steps. To determine how
 well the model predicts passenger survival, a hold-out test set will be used to analyze its accuracy and classification report
